- Creating a view without creating a function or class based view.
    It is possible to create a view by using django in built view called generic views.
    Go to app/urls:
        from django.views.generic import TemplateView

        path('index/', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='tasks/index.html'))
        just specific the template name, this views creates static files. Django automatically do the render for you.
        Disadvantage of this is that you cannot put context in it

Note:
if templates will be in project folder just go to settings
'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'template']

- Look at the templates to see how base templates and extension works

-Creating Views that have context using function based view check
